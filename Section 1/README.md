# Section 1 (supervised learning) image categorizing #

### Goal ###
The goal of section 1 is to make a fully functional image categorizer using the TensorFlow python library for machine
learning (for acceleration of computations and backprop). 

### Features ###
1. Users will be able to create a new classification category (For example, "dog")<br/><br/>
2. Users will upload new images that can be tagged under a category (For example, upload an image of a dog and categorize it as "dog")<br/><br/>
3. Users will be asked to verify that random images are **not** of a certain category (For example, the program will show an image of a carrot and ask the user to verify that this image can not be tagged under "dog")<br/><br/>
4. Users will be able to query the program with new images, and the program will (to an extent) output the best matching category tags for that image.<br/><br/>
