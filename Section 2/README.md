# Section 2 (reinforcement learning) Task Fulfiller #

### Goal ###
The goal of section 2 is to make a bot that fulfills a specific task, without being explicitly programmed to fulfill that task. More specifically,
an arm bot that will have to catch a ball based on an X,Y location of the ball or an image capturing the area of the bot. Starting with a computer
simulation, then buildnig an actual bot to achieve the task in the physical dimension.

### Process ###
1. The bot will be given random balls position and will perform completely random movements.
2. For each movement the bot makes, it will be achieved a score, based on the distance of the arm-tip from the target ball (the closer the arm is, the higher the score)
3. The neural network will be trained using the data from the bot to catch the ball.
4. After a period of time, the bot should get trained to actually catch the ball with a high success rate.
5. The bot simulation will be ported to the physical world.
