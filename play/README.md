# Section 3 (reinforcement learning) Game playing bot #

### Goal ###
The goal of section 3 is to make a bot that can successfully play a 2-player turn-based game. More specifically, Othello.
That, without being explicitly programmed with algorithms, but only trained with examples.

### Process ###
1. The bot will be given a large amount of Othello games from recent world championships to train on.
2. The bot will get to play against different versions of itself, thus creating more games to train on.
3. After training for a long period of time, the bot should successfully play games of Othello.
