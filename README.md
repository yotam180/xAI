## Do you watch us from GitLab™? #

We are **NOT** on GitLab! If you watch this repository through GitLab™, you are watching a live-synced repository. xAI is maintained through
GitHub™, and every commit on the GitHub™ repo is automatically mirrored here (Thanks to GitSync by Yotam Salmon). For our github repo, go to [https://github.com/yotam180/xAI](https://github.com/yotam180/xAI).

Please submit **PR**s and **issues** on our GitHub and not here (changes on our GitHub are mirrored here, but not in the other direction, so we just won't see them)
