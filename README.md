## Do you watch us from GitLab™? #

We are **NOT** on GitLab! If you watch this repository through GitLab™, you are watching a live-synced repository. xAI is maintained through
GitHub™, and every commit on the GitHub™ repo is automatically mirrored here (Thanks to GitSync by Yotam Salmon). For our github repo, go to [https://github.com/yotam180/xAI](https://github.com/yotam180/xAI).

Please submit **PR**s and **issues** on our GitHub and not here (changes on our GitHub are mirrored here, but not in the other direction, so we just won't see them)

>I'm a young software developer, love and live technology and computers. I am mainly experienced with C#, Python and Javascript for web development.<br/>
>I do web development with JS/HTML5/CSS3, jQuery and usually for server side - nodeJS, PHP or ASP.NET. I am also familiar with C/C++, Java based applications
>and Visual Basic, for macros, mainly. When really needed, I do x86 ASM too, but that's on very rare occasions.<br/><br/>
>I contribute to open source projects and am very active in school projects too, like the Makers project or the Rogozin In Space repositories under
